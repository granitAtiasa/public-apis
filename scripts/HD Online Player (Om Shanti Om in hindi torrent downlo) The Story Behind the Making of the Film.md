## Om Shanti Om Movie Review
 
Om Shanti Om is not just a movie, but a celebration of Bollywood. It pays homage to the golden era of Hindi cinema, with references to iconic films, songs, stars and dialogues. It also spoofs the clichÃ©s and conventions of the masala genre, with tongue-in-cheek humour and self-awareness. It is a film that knows its audience and delivers what they expect: drama, comedy, romance, action, music and dance.
 
The film is divided into two parts: the first set in the 1970s and the second in the present day. The first part introduces us to Om Prakash Makhija (Shah Rukh Khan), a junior artist who dreams of becoming a superstar and winning the love of Shantipriya (Deepika Padukone), the reigning diva of Bollywood. His best friend is Pappu (Shreyas Talpade), a fellow struggler who supports him in his aspirations. Om's life takes a tragic turn when he witnesses Shantipriya being killed by her husband and producer Mukesh Mehra (Arjun Rampal), who wants to get rid of her for his selfish motives. Om tries to save her but dies in the process.
 
The second part shows Om reincarnated as Om Kapoor, the son of a famous actor Rajesh Kapoor (Javed Sheikh) and a superstar himself. He suffers from strange flashbacks of his previous life and meets his mother Bela (Kirron Kher) from his past birth. He also encounters Mukesh Mehra, who has returned from Hollywood after 30 years and plans to make a film titled Om Shanti Om. Om decides to use this opportunity to take revenge on Mukesh and expose his crime. He also finds Shantipriya's look-alike Sandy (Deepika Padukone), an aspiring actress who agrees to play the lead role in Mukesh's film. Om tries to make her fall in love with him and also make her remember her past life.
 
The film is full of twists and turns, surprises and shocks, laughs and tears. It is a roller-coaster ride that keeps you hooked till the end. The film boasts of a stellar cast that delivers memorable performances. Shah Rukh Khan is at his charismatic best as both Om Prakash Makhija and Om Kapoor. He displays his versatility as an actor by switching between comedy and drama with ease. He also flaunts his six-pack abs in a song that has become iconic. Deepika Padukone makes an impressive debut as both Shantipriya and Sandy. She exudes grace and charm as the 70s heroine and spunk and confidence as the modern girl. She also shares a sizzling chemistry with Shah Rukh Khan. Arjun Rampal is convincing as the suave and sinister Mukesh Mehra. He plays the villain with style and menace. Shreyas Talpade is hilarious as Pappu, Om's loyal friend who provides comic relief. Kirron Kher is endearing as Bela, Om's mother who waits for him for 30 years.
 
The film also features many cameo appearances by famous Bollywood personalities, such as Amitabh Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan, Rani Mukerji, Preity Zinta, Kajol, Salman Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Sanjay Dutt, Priyanka Chopra, Karisma Kapoor, Rekha, Dharmendra, Jeetendra, Mithun Chakraborty and many more. The film also pays tribute to some of the legends of Hindi cinema who are no more with us, such as Rajesh Khanna, Rishi Kapoor, Vinod Khanna, Dev Anand and others.
 
The film is directed by Farah Khan, who shows her love for Bollywood with her style and vision. She creates a nostalgic atmosphere in the first part with authentic costumes, sets, props and music. She also recreates some of the famous scenes from classic films like Karz, Deewaar, Don and others. She injects humour and fun in the second part with witty dialogues, spoofy situations and spoofy characters. She also choreographs some of the most catchy and colourful songs in the film.
 
The music of the film is composed by Vishal-Shekhar, who create a retro feel in the first part with songs like Ajab Si, Dard-E
