- Start with a template. FL Studio offers several templates that you can use to start your project. You can choose from different genres, such as hip hop, EDM, rock, pop, etc. or create your own template from scratch. To access the templates, go to File > New from template and select the one you want.
- Learn the basics of the interface. FL Studio has four main windows that you need to know: the Browser, the Channel Rack, the Playlist and the Mixer. The Browser is where you can find and access all your files, samples, plugins and presets. The Channel Rack is where you can add and edit your instruments and sounds. The Playlist is where you can arrange and sequence your patterns and audio clips. The Mixer is where you can adjust the volume, pan, effects and routing of your tracks.
- Create a pattern. A pattern is a sequence of notes or sounds that you can play or loop in FL Studio. To create a pattern, you need to add a channel to the Channel Rack. A channel can be a virtual instrument (such as a synthesizer or a sampler) or an audio clip (such as a drum loop or a vocal sample). To add a channel, right-click on an empty slot in the Channel Rack and select Insert > (name of the plugin or sample). To edit a channel, double-click on it or press Enter. To delete a channel, right-click on it and select Delete.
- Use the Step Sequencer or the Piano Roll to input notes. The Step Sequencer is a grid of buttons that you can use to create simple rhythms and melodies. Each button represents a step or a beat in the pattern. To activate a step, left-click on it. To deactivate it, right-click on it. To change the length of the pattern, drag the horizontal scrollbar at the bottom of the Channel Rack. The Piano Roll is a more advanced tool that allows you to input notes with more precision and control. You can access the Piano Roll by clicking on the piano icon in the Channel Rack or by pressing F7. The Piano Roll has a keyboard on the left side and a grid on the right side. To input a note, left-click on the grid where you want it to be. To delete a note, right-click on it. To move or resize a note, drag it with the mouse.
- Add effects and automation. Effects are plugins that can modify or enhance your sound in various ways, such as reverb, delay, distortion, EQ, etc. Automation is a way of changing the parameters of an effect or an instrument over time, such as volume, pitch, filter cutoff, etc. To add an effect to a channel, go to the Mixer and select an empty slot in one of the insert tracks (the ones with numbers). Then click on the arrow icon at the top of the slot and select Select > (name of the effect plugin). To adjust the settings of the effect plugin, double-click on it or press Enter. To automate a parameter of an effect or an instrument plugin, right-click on it and select Create automation clip. This will create an automation clip in the Playlist that you can edit with the mouse.
- Arrange your song in the Playlist. The Playlist is where you can combine your patterns and audio clips into a complete song structure. To add a pattern or an audio clip to the Playlist, drag it from the Browser or from the Channel Rack to an empty track in the Playlist. You can also use Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V to copy and paste patterns or audio clips in the Playlist. To move or resize a pattern or an audio clip in the Playlist, drag it with the mouse.
- Export your song as an audio file. When you are done with your song, you can export it as an audio file that you can play on any device or share online. To export your song as an audio file, go to File > Export > (name of the audio format). You can choose from different formats, such as WAV, MP3 or OGG. You can also adjust some settings before exporting your song, such as quality, bitrate and sample rate.
