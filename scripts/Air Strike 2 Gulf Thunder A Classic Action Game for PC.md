In this article, we will explore some of the features and benefits of Max 7, and how it can help you unleash your creativity and imagination.
  
## What can you do with Max 7?
 
Max 7 is a versatile and flexible tool that can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:
 
- Designing custom synthesizers, samplers, effects, and sequencers
- Manipulating audio, video, images, and data in real time
- Creating interactive installations, performances, and games
- Prototyping and testing new ideas and concepts
- Generating code for web sites, plug-ins, embedded hardware, or any C++ based applications

Max 7 is compatible with many hardware devices and software platforms, such as MIDI controllers, OSC devices, Arduino boards, Ableton Live, Unity, Processing, and more. You can also extend Max 7 with add-ons from the built-in Package Manager, which offers over 50 packages covering everything from computer vision to support for hardware controllers.
  
## What are some of the new features in Max 7?
 
Max 7 introduces several new features that make it easier and more fun to create with Max. Some of these features are:

- RNBO: A Max-inspired patching environment built to export code for web sites, plug-ins, embedded hardware, or any C++ based applications. You can also use RNBO to learn how to code by visualizing the connections between objects.
- Jitter: A set of tools for working with video and graphics in real time. Jitter is optimized for audiovisual work, and can be combined with audio, sequencing, and modulation like everything else in Max.
- Gen: A system for creating custom processes for audio, matrix data, or texture processing. Gen lets you combine procedural commands with visual patching to simplify the creation of complex algorithms. Gen objects can also output source code to be used elsewhere if needed.
- Snippets: A way to save and share small pieces of your patch as reusable components. Snippets can be dragged and dropped into any patcher window, or exported as standalone files.
- Patcher Inspector: A tool that lets you view and edit the properties of any object in your patcher. You can also use the Patcher Inspector to access documentation, tutorials, examples, and tips for any object.
